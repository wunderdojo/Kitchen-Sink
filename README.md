Restore's the "kitchen sink" label to the TinyMCE toolbar in WordPress. Inspired by @kitchensinkwp. 



## Plugin Features

None. Literally. All it does it restore the label "kitchen sink" when you hover over the toobar toggle button in TinyMCE.

## Screenshots
Here it is in all its glory.

You can even translate "Kitchen Sink" to your favorite language! (Or at least let Google take a crack at it.)

## Frequently Asked Questions

Why does this exist? 
Because Adam Silver, host of the Kitchen Sink WP podcast, jokingly asked for it and it seemed like a fun distraction from real work.
